## macOS Setup (iMessage)

### Requirements

- macOS with Messages app
- Messages in iCloud enabled (on both iPhone and Mac)
- Python 3 (pre-installed on macOS)

### 1. Grant Terminal Permissions

Open **System Settings > Privacy & Security** and add Terminal to:
- **Full Disk Access** (required)
- **Accessibility** (for sync automation)

For **Contacts** access, run this in Terminal to trigger the permission prompt:

```bash
osascript -e 'tell application "Contacts" to get name of first person'
```

Click **OK** when the popup appears. Restart Terminal after granting permissions.

### 2. Sync Your Messages (if needed)

If your iCloud Messages sync keeps pausing:

```bash
chmod +x desmond.sh
./desmond.sh
```

Desmond will click Sync Now every 15 seconds and show your progress:

```
[15:44:08] ====== STARTING ======
[15:44:08] Messages on Mac: 142,847
[15:44:08] Conversations: 89
[15:44:08] ========================

[15:44:23] Push #2 - +312 new messages (total: 143,159)
[15:44:38] Push #3 - +287 new messages (total: 143,446)
...

[15:52:53] ====== SYNC APPEARS COMPLETE ======
[15:52:53] Final count: 346,476 messages
[15:52:53] "See you in another life, brother."
```

**Optional:** Set a target if you know your message count:

```bash
./desmond.sh 346000
```

### 3. Export Your Messages

```bash
python3 imessage_exporter.py --full
```

### 4. Automatic Exports (optional)

To run exports hourly in the background:

```bash
chmod +x setup_imessage_exporter.sh
./setup_imessage_exporter.sh
```

## Android Setup (SMS/MMS)

Works on both **Windows** and **macOS**.

### Requirements

2. Tap **Backup Now**
3. Select **Messages** (and optionally **Call Logs**)
4. Choose backup location:
   - **Local storage** - then transfer the XML file to your computer
   - **Google Drive** - then download the XML file to your computer
5. Wait for backup to complete
6. Transfer the `.xml` file to your computer (Downloads folder works best)

### 3. Export Your Messages

```cmd
# Double-click android_export_windows.bat
# Or run:
python android_sms_exporter.py
```

**On macOS:**
```bash

```
